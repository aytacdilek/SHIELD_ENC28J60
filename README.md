# ENC28j60 SHIELD
This is a simple arduino type board to work on ENC28j60 ethernet controller. It is very simillar to populer ethernet shield boards except it has temperature and humidity sensor, RTC, and EEPROM on the shield. You can write codes to practice on web-servers or simillar web applications.

This board is 3.3V specific. So, I do not recommend to work on arduino boards. If you are a STM32 microcontroller family fun, you can practice on NUCLEO boards. Or you can try my MSP-DUINO board which is a arduino type board with MSP430 microcontroller.

Have fun!
